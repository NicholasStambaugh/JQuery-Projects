# A JavaScript number counter

To use and implement this code, follow these steps:

1. Include the required dependencies: jQuery, Bootstrap, and countTo.js.

2. Copy and paste the code into your script.js file, or into a separate JavaScript file if you prefer.

3. Ensure that the HTML markup for the counters is set up correctly. Each counter should be contained within a .counter-item element, and have a data-to attribute specifying the target value for the counter. For example:

```
<div class="counter-item">
    <span class="counter-value" data-to="100">0</span>
    <p class="counter-label">Happy Customers</p>
</div>

```
4. The code will automatically initialize the counter animation when the page loads. As the user scrolls down the page, the counters will animate into view and count up to their target values.

5. If you need to modify the animation trigger point, adjust the value -800 in the code to a different value that suits your needs. This value determines the distance (in pixels) between the top of the browser window and the element before the animation begins.

6. If you need to customize the appearance or behavior of the counter animation, you can modify the code to suit your needs. Refer to the comments in the code for guidance on how to make changes.

7. Finally, test your implementation thoroughly to ensure that the counters are animating correctly and that there are no errors or issues with the code.
